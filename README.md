# Introdução à Matemática e Física Para Videojogos II - Test particle system

This is the base for a particle system in Python, as an exercice for the students of the [Licenciatura em Videojogos][lv] da
[Universidade Lusófona de Humanidades e Tecnologias][ULHT] in Lisbon.

The particle system was built using:
* Python 3.6
* Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/news)

In the current state, the particle system does nothing, the idea is for the students to apply the knowledge of the previous lecture to make it work.

## Installation of required modules

To run the sample application, you'll have to install all the used modules:

* `pip install pygame`

If pip is not available on the command line, you can try to invoke it through the module interface on Python:

* `python -m pip install <name of package>`
